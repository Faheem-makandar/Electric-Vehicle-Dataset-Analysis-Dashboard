# Electric-Vehicle-Dataset-Analysis-Dashboard
A comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing electric vehicle (EV) adoption, trends, model performance, and state-wise distribution in the United States.

📌 Project Overview

This project visualizes and analyzes Electric Vehicle (EV) data using an interactive Power BI dashboard.
It provides insights into:

EV growth over model years

Distribution of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) vs Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)

State-wise adoption patterns

Top EV Makes & Models

Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility

Average electric driving range

Filters for Model, State, Make, EV Type, and CAFV status

This dashboard helps understand EV adoption trends and supports decision-making in sustainability, energy planning, automobile research, and transportation analytics.

🧾 Key Metrics (KPIs)
🔹 Total Vehicles

1,50,413 registered electric vehicles in the dataset.

🔹 Total BEV Vehicles

1,16,745 (≈77.6% of total EVs)

🔹 Total PHEV Vehicles

33,668 (≈22.4% of total EVs)

🔹 Average Electric Range

67.83 miles

📊 Dashboard Highlights
1️⃣ EV Trend by Model Year

Shows EV adoption growth from 2011–2024.

Peak growth observed around 2022–2023 with 27K–37K vehicles.

Average yearly adoption ≈ 10.7K EVs.

2️⃣ State-wise Vehicle Distribution Map

Choropleth map showing EV count per US state.

Highest EV adoption visible in major states such as Washington, California, Texas, etc.

3️⃣ Top 10 EV Makes

TESLA dominates with 68,393 vehicles (52.7%)

Other significant brands: Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, BMW, Kia, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo, Jeep.

4️⃣ CAFV Eligibility

41.81% EVs eligible

11.85% not eligible

46.34% unknown/unreported

5️⃣ EV Count by Model

Top models include:

Tesla Model Y – 28,501

Tesla Model 3 – 27,708

Nissan Leaf – 13,187

Tesla Model S – 7,609

Chevrolet Bolt EV – 7,608

📌 Tools Used
1. Tableau Desktop

Designed and developed the entire interactive dashboard

Performed data cleaning, modeling, and visualization

2. Excel / CSV Dataset

Source data imported directly into Tableau

Used Excel for initial basic formatting

3. Tableau Mapbox Integration

Used for the U.S. state-wise choropleth map

Provides accurate geospatial mapping


📈 Insights & Conclusion

Tesla remains the clear market leader in EV adoption.

EV adoption has skyrocketed after 2020.

Western and larger states show higher EV concentration.

Majority of registered EVs are BEVs, indicating user preference for fully electric vehicles.

CAFV eligibility data still has many unknowns, meaning reporting can be improved.
